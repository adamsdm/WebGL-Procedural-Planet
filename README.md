# Procedural planet 
Made this as a project in a procedural images course.
The application is built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), aswell as [ashima's webgl-noise](https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise) 



## Instructions
To allow for cross-origin resources, the application needs to run on a server.

1. Navigate to folder
2. In terminal type '$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000'
3. Open 'localhost:8000' in your webrowser.

Alternatively, a live demo can be seen [here](http://www.adamsoderstrom.se/WebGL-Procedural-Planet/).
